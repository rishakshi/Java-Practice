-- Using MySQL recursive CTE to traverse the hierarchical data

-- The  employees table has the reportsTo column that references to the employeeNumber column. The reportsTo column stores the ids of managers. The top manager does not report to anyone in the companyâ€™s organization structure, therefore, the value in the reportsTo column is NULL.

-- You can apply the recursive CTE to query the whole organization structure in the top-down manner
